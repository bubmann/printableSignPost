# printableSignPost
a parametric design for OpenSCAD to create printable, stenciled sign-posts

right now set up for 0.6mm nozzle and 2mm perimeter

I think the readability is higher if you mirror the model and print it face down

# todo
make line-spacing and stem-position dependent on textSize

parameterize perimeter options

parameterize material-saving options

maybe alter the routine to only emboss the perimeter while saving material, when creating multi-line signs
